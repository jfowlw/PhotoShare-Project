album.html changes
- changed action from "add album" to "addAlbum"
- changed href from 'path to album' to '/viewAlbum?album_id={{album.0}}'
	and changed {album stuff} to {album.1}} which is the album name

pictures.html changes
-changed photoList in for loop to photos
-changed things like photo.image and photo.photo_id to photo.0 and photo.1 to
	access indexes of photo tuples

something about how the photos are being encoded doesn't seem to be working. the data exists but either isn't all being stored or isnt being encoded correctly. I don't think this problem is on our end because the hello.html page should be displaying the users photos, but has only been displaying the captions

should we have a seperate template for browsing all pictures in all albums, or change our pictures template so that it only shows delete button if you're viewing your own album

for browsing and viewing your albums, should comments be visible or should we have a separate page to view all of a photos comments
